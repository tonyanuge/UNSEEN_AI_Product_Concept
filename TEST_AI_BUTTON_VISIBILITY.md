   - Navigate to any active chat
   - Look for purple "AI" button with Brain icon in top-right area

   - Login as test001@unseen.app / password123
   - Navigate to any active chat or create new match
   - Look for SAME purple "AI" button with Brain icon
   - Click the button - should open AI Coaching panel
   - Check console logs for: `üß† ChatInterface AI Coaching clicked`

## Expected Results

**BOTH admin and regular users should see:**
- Purple "AI" button with Brain icon 
- Button positioned in top-right area of chat header
- Clicking opens AI Coaching panel
- Console logs show successful click handling

## Debug Logs to Watch

```
üîç useAdmin DEBUG - User: [USER_ID] isAdmin: true/false
üîç ChatInterface rendering for user: [USER_ID]  
üîç ChatInterface onOpenCoaching prop: true
üß† ChatInterface AI Coaching clicked - Available to ALL users
```

## Key Technical Details

- AI button is in `ChatInterface` component (used by ALL users)
- Button has `className="bg-purple-600 hover:bg-purple-700 text-white font-bold px-3 py-2 min-w-[60px] flex-shrink-0 shadow-lg border-2 border-purple-400"`
- No conditional rendering based on user type
- `useAdmin` hook now returns true for ALL authenticated users
- Only diagnostic tools use `useAdminDiagnostics` for real admin restrictions

## If AI Button Still Missing

The issue would likely be:
1. CSS/responsive design hiding the button on mobile
2. Component not receiving proper props
3. WebSocket/authentication issues preventing proper component mounting
4. Browser cache or hot-reload issues
