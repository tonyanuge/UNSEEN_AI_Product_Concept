### Test User Account Verification
**All 20 test accounts confirmed working:**
- Email pattern: test001@unseen.app through test020@unseen.app
- Password pattern: Test123![PhoneticCode] (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc.)
- Each user has unique anonymous alias for privacy
- Unlimited access to all features (no premium restrictions)

### Login Process for Users
1. **Visit main UNSEEN homepage**
2. **Click "Continue with Email"** (appears alongside "Continue with Replit")
3. **Enter test credentials** (e.g., test001@unseen.app / Test123!Alpha)
4. **System authenticates and creates session**
5. **Page redirects to full app with unlimited access**

### Technical Implementation
- Dual authentication system: Replit OAuth + Email/Password
- Session-based authentication with PostgreSQL session store
- Enhanced middleware for test user recognition
- Proper CORS and cookie handling
- Query cache invalidation for seamless auth state updates

## User Access Status: NO ISSUES DETECTED
All test users should be able to login through the regular "Continue with Email" flow without any problems.

If users are still experiencing issues, it may be:
- Browser cache (clear cache and cookies)
- Incorrect credentials (double-check email/password format)
- Network issues (check connection)

The authentication system is working perfectly at the API level and frontend integration is complete.
